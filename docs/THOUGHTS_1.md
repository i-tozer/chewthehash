This project is about turning a basic transaction “explainer” into core infrastructure for the Sui blockchain. Instead of being a small tool that helps developers debug transactions, it should become a standard layer that improves safety, clarity, and trust for everyone using Sui. The idea is that wallets, apps, and even future AI agents would rely on it to understand what a transaction actually does before and after it runs.
To get there, three big things have to happen. First, the technology must be excellent and built the “right” way for Sui’s future. That means using Sui’s newer gRPC APIs instead of the older JSON-RPC system, which is being phased out. It also means building a smart decoding system that understands Sui’s complex transaction structure, especially Programmable Transaction Blocks, where many actions can be bundled into one transaction. Second, the project needs deep adoption across the ecosystem. Rather than living as a standalone website, it should be built directly into major wallets and offered to app developers through easy SDKs and components. Third, the system must be designed for the future. It should support AI agents, privacy features like zero-knowledge transactions, and cross-chain activity as Sui evolves.
Timing is important. Sui is shutting down JSON-RPC in favor of gRPC, so building on gRPC now ensures the project will not need a painful rebuild later. At the same time, Sui is moving toward a world that includes AI-driven activity and more privacy. If the explainer is designed with those trends in mind, it stays relevant instead of becoming outdated.
Sui’s architecture is different from many other blockchains. Everything is built around “objects,” which are like individual on-chain entities with their own data and ownership. Transactions can include up to 1,024 operations in a single block, and all of them succeed or fail together. Because of this complexity, raw technical data is not helpful to normal users. They need explanations in human terms, like which assets changed, which objects were modified, and why a transaction failed.
The best place to deliver these explanations is inside wallets. Major wallets such as Sui Wallet, Suiet, Ethos, and Martian are where users approve transactions. Showing clear explanations right before signing can reduce mistakes, scams, and confusion. That is why wallet integrations are a top priority.
On the technical side, the system should be built around Sui’s gRPC services. These services stream live transaction data, provide access to Move smart contract metadata, allow historical lookups, and support transaction simulations. By pulling Move package information, the explainer can understand the structure of on-chain data and decode it properly. The design should be modular, so custom decoders can be added for popular apps, while a general fallback still explains less common transactions. Simulations are especially important because they let users see the likely results of a transaction before they sign it, including balance changes and object updates.
The backend data system should track transactions and objects in a reliable, repeatable way using checkpoints from the chain. It should cache common schemas to stay fast. The general pattern is to use gRPC for heavy backend work and GraphQL or similar tools to serve data efficiently to apps and wallets.
Looking ahead, the explainer should produce two kinds of outputs. One is for humans, with clear summaries. The other is structured, machine-readable data for AI agents and automated systems. As Sui introduces privacy features, the system should show high-level descriptions for private transactions without revealing sensitive details. It should also be able to explain cross-chain flows, like assets moving between Sui and Ethereum, by tying multiple steps into one clear story.
Adoption will not happen automatically, so there needs to be a deliberate ecosystem strategy. A design partner program with a few key wallets and high-volume apps can help shape the product early. Grants, bounties, hackathons, and co-marketing with the Sui Foundation can encourage developers to integrate the explainer.
Instead of trying to decode everything at once, the team should focus first on the most common transaction types. Data from indexers can show which apps and functions are used most. Early priorities should include DeFi actions like swaps and liquidity, NFT minting and transfers, and common gaming transactions. Covering these areas well will make the tool useful to most users quickly.
For funding and RFP alignment, the MVP should meet the basic requirements: a public web app where someone can input a transaction and see a clear explanation of what happened, including object changes and gas usage. Beyond that, the proposal should show a path to simulations, wallet integrations, and developer SDKs, proving this is more than a simple demo.
To make integration easy, the project should offer ready-to-use UI components for apps and wallets, along with stable APIs. A plugin SDK can allow the community to build decoders for additional projects. This lowers friction and helps create a consistent user experience across Sui.
A sustainable business model could be open core. Basic decoding stays open and accessible, while hosted services offer higher limits, simulations at scale, and enterprise features like SLAs and custom risk tools. This balances community trust with long-term viability.
There are real risks to manage. Popular apps change quickly, so decoder coverage can become outdated. APIs are evolving, so building on gRPC reduces future migration pain. Complex transactions can be hard to explain, so the system needs detailed error pinpointing. Privacy features could introduce compliance issues if handled poorly, so careful redaction and placeholder explanations are needed. Rare chain inconsistencies must be handled with robust data ingestion.
The roadmap spans about nine months. The first three months focus on the core decoder, infrastructure, and MVP app. Midway, private beta testing with partners helps refine integrations and performance. By months eight and nine, the goal is a public beta with broader developer access and strong coverage of key transaction types.
Community engagement is treated as part of the engineering effort. Structured user research, active GitHub work, Discord support, hackathons, and regular updates all help drive feedback and adoption.
In short, this project aims to become the standard way people and systems understand Sui transactions. By combining strong technical foundations, deep wallet integration, future-ready design, and active ecosystem engagement, the transaction explainer can move from a simple tool to essential network infrastructure.
